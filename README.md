This project is an implementation of Command Design Pattern to help the object persistence. Based on Java technology it helps to persist any object in that way:

command.save(object)

and recovery it in that way

command.get(object)
command.list(criteria)

This project helps a lot with reducing the bugs and improving the speed of projects.
